# Kubernetes Security Best Practices

## Introduction
This README provides best practices and practical tasks for enhancing security in a Kubernetes environment. It covers various topics such as cluster setup, hardening, microservice vulnerabilities, supply chain security, monitoring, identity management, network policies, incident response, and more.

## Cluster Setup
- **Scenario:** You've been tasked with setting up a Kubernetes cluster for your organisation. Your first task is to ensure that the cluster is configured securely from the outset. Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to create a user with limited permissions, such as only being able to view pods in a specific namespace.
- **Answer:** To achieve this, you can create a Role and RoleBinding in Kubernetes to grant the user the necessary permissions.
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorisation.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: your-namespace
  name: pod-viewer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```
You can then bind this Role to a specific user or group using a RoleBinding.

## Cluster Hardening
- **Scenario:** Building upon the previous scenario, now that your cluster is set up, your next task is to further harden it to prevent unauthorised access and attacks. Utilise Network Policies to restrict inbound traffic to only allow connections from specific IP addresses or subnets.
- **Answer:** You can use Network Policies to control traffic within your Kubernetes cluster.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-specific-ip
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
        except:
        - 192.168.1.5/32
```

## System Hardening
- **Scenario:** With the cluster hardened, your next task is to harden the underlying system to mitigate potential security risks. Implement Pod Security Policies to ensure that all pods in the cluster run with restricted privileges and cannot escalate their permissions.
- **Answer:** Pod Security Policies (PSPs) can be used to define the security settings that pods must adhere to.

## Minimise Microservice Vulnerabilities
- **Scenario:** Given that your system and cluster are hardened, your team is now focusing on addressing vulnerabilities specific to microservices running within the Kubernetes environment. Identify a vulnerable container image used by one of your microservices and replace it with a more secure version.
- **Answer:** To address vulnerabilities in container images, you should regularly scan your images for known vulnerabilities and update them as necessary.

## Supply Chain Security
- **Scenario:** Your team is now tasked with ensuring the security of the supply chain, including the deployment of trusted container images. Set up image scanning in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and block the deployment of container images with known vulnerabilities.
- **Answer:** Integrating container image scanning into your CI/CD pipeline is crucial for ensuring the security of your supply chain.

## Monitoring, Logging, and Runtime Security
- **Scenario:** As part of your ongoing efforts to enhance security, you need to implement monitoring and logging mechanisms within your cluster to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time. Configure Prometheus and Grafana to collect metrics from your cluster and set up alerts for any suspicious activity.
- **Answer:** Prometheus and Grafana are commonly used tools for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.

## Identity and Access Management
- **Scenario:** Building upon the previous scenario, your next task is to enhance identity and access management to ensure only authorised entities can interact with your Kubernetes resources. Integrate your Kubernetes cluster with an LDAP or Active Directory server for centralised user authentication and authorisation.
- **Answer:** Integrating Kubernetes with an LDAP or Active Directory server allows you to manage user authentication and authorisation centrally.

## Network Policies
- **Scenario:** With access controls in place, your team is now focusing on enforcing network policies to restrict communication between different parts of your Kubernetes cluster. Write a Network Policy that denies egress traffic from a specific pod to prevent data exfiltration.
- **Answer:** Network Policies allow you to control traffic between pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Security Contexts
- **Scenario:** Given the network policies implemented, your next task is to utilise security contexts to further isolate and secure individual pods and containers within the cluster. Identify a pod running with elevated privileges and update its security context to run with a non-root user.
- **Answer:** Security Contexts allow you to set Linux capabilities and SELinux options for pods and containers in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Service Mesh Security
- **Scenario:** Your team is now considering implementing a service mesh to enhance security between services in your Kubernetes environment. Install and configure Istio as a service mesh and enforce mutual TLS authentication between services.
- **Answer:** Istio provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices running in Kubernetes.

## Pod Security Policies/Security Policy
- **Scenario:** Building upon the previous scenario, your next task is to enforce pod security policies or security policies to ensure that all pods adhere to predefined security standards. Write a Pod Security Policy that requires all pods to run with read-only root filesystems.
- **Answer:** Pod Security Policies (PSPs) define a set of security standards that pods must adhere to.

## Incident Response
- **Scenario:** Finally, with all security measures in place, your team needs to establish an incident response plan to effectively mitigate and respond to security breaches within your Kubernetes environment. Simulate a security incident, such as a pod compromise, and follow your incident response plan to contain and remediate the issue.
- **Answer:** An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.
